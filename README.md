# UWP Wrapper for Pocketcasts Web App

This is a just-for-fun project, as my first dabble into UWP/C# world.

I may have used just the Hosted Web App template, but:
* I want to learn C# and UWP app development
* I needed to use the media keys and I can't inject code into Hosted Web Apps to do that (there must be a way, so if it is somewhere I may nuke this project to implement that)

# TODO list
- [ ] Learn ~~to program~~ C# and UWP.
- [ ] Make the size of the webview the same of the viewport.
- [ ] Update the media controls display with podcast info.
- [ ] Polish (A LOT)
